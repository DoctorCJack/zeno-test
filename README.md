# zeno-test
Files used for testing [DoctorCJack/ZENO](https://github.com/DoctorCJack/ZENO) (formerly mvk1-nist/ZENO).<br><br>
The files from [DoctorCJack/ZENO](https://github.com/DoctorCJack/ZENO) are assumed to be stored in a directory `~/zeno-modified`, but this can be changed in `filepath.cfg`.<br><br>
The existing .csv files are there as example outputs for `get-csvs.sh` and `compile-output.py`.



## First edition README
Files used for testing [mvk1-nist/ZENO](https://github.com/mvk1-nist/ZENO).<br><br>
[usnistgov/ZENO](https://github.com/usnistgov/ZENO) was stored in a directory `~/zeno-original` with a locally added step counter.<br>
[mvk1-nist/ZENO](https://github.com/mvk1-nist/ZENO) was developed in `~/zeno-modified` and was run separately in `~/zeno-run-modified` due to slowdowns caused by a connection to CLion.<br>

The existing .csv files are there as example outputs for `get-csvs.sh` and `compile-output.py`.
